This is a video game created using PyGame. It is purely Python code. The sound effects, music, and sprite sheets were used from the site called OpenGameArt.org 

All other art work was created by me. 

To run the application, you will need to download the file, unzip it, and open it in either PyCharm or Visual Studio Code. Run the application and everything should work.

Hope you enjoy it!!!
